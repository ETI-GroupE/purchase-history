Starting up in Golang: Honestly no clue

Starting up in Docker: Cloning this repository, going into the path of this repository,
doing docker build -t <image name> . and i do not know afterwards

Environment Variable disclaimer
Because environment variables are stored locally and cannot be commited into github,
running this service locally cannot be done so. It is for safety reasons (Personally my database got hacked twice)













































































// For Mr Wes only: Because I am not so good at coding and yes I have asked around for help, I am still
unable to finish due to time constraints of this project.
